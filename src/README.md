# SRC

This directory stores the source code for this project. For more on why `src/` is used, see [this blog post](https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/#the-structure%3E).

## Reminder to be inside `/src/` when debugging logic in child dir `elt_practice_2024`

For instance, this repo assumes that you're inside of `src/` and that you're running `python` like this: 

```python
python elt_practice_2024/data_extraction.py
```
