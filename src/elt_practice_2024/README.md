# ELT Practice 2024

## Reminder to be inside `/src/elt_practice_2024/` when running `python` statements

For instance, this repo assumes that you're inside of `src/_practice_2024` and that you're running `python` like this: 

```python
python data_extraction.py
```

This ensures that the local import statements remain the same between application code and the test code.
