# Workflows

GitHub Actions uses YAML syntax to define the workflow. Each workflow is stored as a separate YAML file in your code repository, in a directory named `.github/workflows`.

You can create an example workflow in your repository that automatically triggers a series of commands whenever code is pushed. To learn more, see this example from [the official GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows#create-an-example-workflow).
